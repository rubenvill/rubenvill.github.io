      The problem with phone hype is that it creates a sensation of knowing up and coming tech specs, but not acknowledging we should focus on the quality of life improvements that each generation of tech can bring. Everybody just gets hyperfocused on how fast things are going, rather than knowing how much better and more fulfilling living a slow life can be.

I like to think about the the fact that we lived for 97 years and our most efficient way to communicate was a landline.
Then it was 34 years later and we’ve got the iPhone. At the same time of technological advance, the internet boom been dead for 5 years. This is plenty of time for people to establish themselves within their niche little Internet forums.
<br><br>
Fast forward to now.
<br><br>
Now humans have globalized the population to the extent that any person with any thought can express their thoughts to the world. But of course society runs as normal and people have to fit in, but isn’t it interesting that one company has 34 percent of the population going through their API? We talk about how powerful the richest billionaires are, but seriously?
<br><br>
How the fuck have we not petitioned for ownership of our information yet? The GDP from advertisements is 7.4 TRILLION DOLLARS. That’s 19% of our GDP. Candidates are starting to bring up UBI, why are we not contributing to the idea by implementing a VAT. Like people are saying, robots are fuckin coming. VAT those robot miles too on the new Tesla Truck, also every person about to be replaced by a fucking kiosk.

Want a boost in the economy? give people money so they can even have a chance at making a difference in our society, whether it’s creating a new service, or demonstrating their democracy. We have the framework to protect our rights, yet we’re allowing a pretty gnarly distribution of power. What happened to the theory of justice? How come we have the opportunity to make our worst off better than if we relied on communism, but we just say “He worked for his money.”
<br><br><br>
The best thing about having our government in the first place is that it unifies us in a common goal. Why wouldn’t that common goal be to have prosperity for everyone in our nation??
